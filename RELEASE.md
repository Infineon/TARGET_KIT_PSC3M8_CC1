# KIT_PSC3M8_CC1 BSP Release Notes
The PSOC™ Control C3M8 Digital Power Control Card (KIT_PSC3M8_CC1) is based on the Infineon PSOC™ Control C3M8 microcontroller and features an onboard debugger along with a 120-pin edge connector for seamless integration with compatible power boards. Powered by an Arm® Cortex®-M33 based PSOC™ Control MCU, the card is designed to evaluate, develop, and demonstrate advanced digital power control applications. When paired with supported power boards, it showcases the capabilities of the PSOC™ Control C3M8 device for power conversion, motor control, and other real-time power stage control applications. The card plugs into a standard 120-pin edge connector, providing a flexible platform for rapid prototyping, system evaluation, and application development using the PSOC™ Control C3M8 MCU.

**Note:** Programming this kit requires installing [SEGGER J-Link software](https://www.segger.com/downloads/jlink/#J-LinkSoftwareAndDocumentationPack).
